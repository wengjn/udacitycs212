set: a set is an ordered collection of elements with no duplicates.
unordered, no duplicates!!!

A-B  in A but not in B
A|B  A or B
A&B  A and B
A^B  without the common area


List: count, sort, reverse
list.count(r): return number of occurences of x in list
list.sort(): sort the list in place
list.reverse(): reverse the elements of the list in place

this sort doesn't create another new list, it is in place, change the 
original one
b = a.sort()
print out b would be None
same as reverse: in place, remember it is in place


Generators:
1. how do we use it???
with yield, we create generator object func
2. what is generator expression/function/objects???
3.when and why do we use generators???
whenever you call the func, you create a new generator object, if you want 
to continue use that object, you have to assign it to others
if next(gen(11)) be 0, then
next(gen(11)) would also be 0
