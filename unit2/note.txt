Zebra puzzle
do the assignment, each house with properties(nation, color, pet, drink,
        smoke)

funny picture about solution time:
million, billion, trillion

itertools library has permutation module could be used

Need to understand what 'List Comprehensions' are?
[s for r,s in cards if r in 'JQK']...we can have more 'for' 'if' after that
as long as a 'for' comes first

Generator Expression:
g=(sq(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0)

Timing --- measurement
timecall()
    time.clock()

def something(fn, *args):
  fn(*args)
something(f, 1,2,3)  tuple (1,2,3) into args
zip and unzip relation

aspect orient programming
correct, efficient, debug


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cryptarithmetic

eval('2+2') = 4 # evaluate a string expression

Regular Expression:
re.search(r'\b0[0-9]', f) to be not True
\b is boundary, starting with 0 and later any letter
eval('012') = 10, based on 8, Octal number, start from 0

python build a time machine
from __future__ import division
it is called future import, since:
in Python2.x: 3/2 we get 1 and 1/2 we get 0, the designers said when you do
the intergers division, you probablly want an integer result
in Python3: 3/2 we get 1.5, and 1/2 we get 0.5, the designers thought the 
previous design is confusing
if you want python3 feature in python2.x, you need to import __future__

print out a table on time and the function
 python -m cProfile cryptarithmetic.py
so we can know how to improve the program 

lambda function
f = lambda Y,M,E,U,O:(1*U+10*O+100*Y)==(1*E+10*M)**2

re.split()
